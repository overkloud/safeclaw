# Cloud hosting options for SafeClaw

Research on running SafeClaw's Docker container in the cloud for free.

## Best options ranked

### 1. Google Cloud Run - best DX + value balance

- **Always free:** 180,000 vCPU-seconds/month (~50 hrs), 360,000 GB-seconds memory (~100 hrs at 1 GB), 2M requests/month
- **Egress:** 1 GB/month from North America (small)
- **Regions:** us-central1, us-east1, us-west1 only
- **Credit card:** Required
- **Deploy:** `gcloud run deploy --source .` from a Dockerfile
- **Catches:** Stateless/serverless only - container spins up per request, no SSH, no persistent filesystem. Cold starts if scaled to zero. 1 GB egress is tight. Billing misconfiguration can cause charges.
- **SafeClaw fit:** Good for request-driven usage (Telegram/Discord bot receiving messages). Not suitable for always-on workloads.

### 2. Oracle Cloud - best raw value

- **Always free:** 4 ARM cores (Ampere A1), 24 GB RAM, 200 GB disk, 10 TB bandwidth
- **Credit card:** Required
- **SSH:** Full access, real VMs
- **Deploy:** SSH in, install Docker, `docker run`
- **Catches:** Signup rejection is common. ARM instance provisioning often fails due to capacity in popular regions. You manage everything yourself - updates, SSL, networking, firewall rules.
- **SafeClaw fit:** Best for always-on SafeClaw instance. 24 GB RAM is more than enough. Full Docker support. But you're a sysadmin.

### 3. Render - easiest DX

- **Always free:** 750 instance hours/month, 100 GB bandwidth, 500 build minutes
- **Credit card:** Required
- **Deploy:** Connect GitHub repo, auto-deploys on push
- **Catches:** Services sleep after 15 min inactivity (~60s cold start). Ephemeral filesystem - all data lost on redeploy/restart/sleep. Free Postgres expires after 90 days.
- **SafeClaw fit:** Easy to set up but sleep behavior and ephemeral storage are problematic for persistent memory feature.

### 4. Koyeb - no credit card needed

- **Always free:** 0.1 vCPU, 512 MB RAM, 2 GB SSD
- **Credit card:** Not required
- **Deploy:** Dockerfile or pre-built image
- **Catches:** Very low CPU (0.1 vCPU), single service only
- **SafeClaw fit:** Too small for running Claude Code + Playwright inside a container.

### 5. Hugging Face Spaces - no credit card needed

- **Always free:** 2 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, supports Dockerfiles
- **Credit card:** Not required
- **Catches:** Sleeps after inactivity, designed for ML demos but works for any Docker app
- **SafeClaw fit:** Generous specs but sleep behavior is a problem.

## Other options (not recommended)

| Provider | Why not |
|----------|---------|
| AWS EC2 | 12-month trial only (t3.micro, 1 GB RAM), then you pay |
| Azure B1S | 12-month trial only (1 GB RAM) |
| Fly.io | Free tier effectively dead for new users (2-hour trial) |
| Railway | 30-day $5 trial only, then $5/month |
| Clever Cloud | Trial only, no real free tier |

## Recommendation for SafeClaw

**For a Telegram/Discord bot that processes messages on demand:** Google Cloud Run. The serverless model fits - bot receives message, container spins up, processes it, dies. Free tier covers moderate usage easily.

**For an always-on instance with persistent memory:** Oracle Cloud. Only option with enough free resources to run SafeClaw 24/7 with Docker + Playwright + Claude Code. Requires more setup effort.

**Hybrid approach:** Use Cloud Run for the bot interface, and Oracle Cloud (if you can get an instance) for heavy/persistent workloads.
